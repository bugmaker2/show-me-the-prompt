## 🚀 What's This?

This is a prompt repo.

Not a prompt zoo.  
Not a prompt graveyard.  
Not a "2000 ChatGPT tricks you can't miss" list.

Just a home for:
- Prompts that actually work
- Prompt patterns that make sense
- Prompt ideas that age like wine

Because these days, writing a good prompt feels like casting a spell.  
And hey, wizards need a spellbook.

## 🧠 Background

Linus once said:  
> “Talk is cheap. Show me the code.” [Linus Torvalds, LKML, 2000](https://lkml.org/lkml/2000/8/25/132)

That made sense — back when code was king.

Now?  
We whisper to the machines, and they *understand*.

Prompts are the new code.  
The prompt engineer is the new wizard.  
And GitHub... well, GitHub is still GitHub.

So here we are:  
> **Show me the prompt.**

Prompts are the new shell scripts.  
Let’s make them readable, reusable, and ridiculous.
