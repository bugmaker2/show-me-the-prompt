# Writing as Thinking

## What it does
This prompt helps you use writing as a tool for thinking and problem-solving. It encourages stream-of-consciousness writing to explore ideas, clarify thoughts, and discover new connections.

## When to use
- When you're stuck on a problem and need to think through it
- When you want to explore a complex topic or idea
- When you need to organize scattered thoughts
- When you're brainstorming and want to capture all ideas
- When you need to work through emotional or logical blocks

## The prompt

```
I want to use writing as a tool for thinking about [TOPIC/PROBLEM]. 

Please act as my thinking partner. I'll write stream-of-consciousness thoughts, and you'll help me:

1. **Clarify** - Ask questions that help me think more clearly
2. **Connect** - Point out patterns, themes, or connections I might miss
3. **Challenge** - Gently question assumptions or push me to think deeper
4. **Capture** - Summarize key insights and help me organize my thoughts

Don't try to solve the problem for me. Instead, help me think better by being a thoughtful, curious listener who occasionally asks the right question.

I'll start writing now, and you can respond when you have something helpful to add or ask.
```

## Sample output
*User writes:* "I'm trying to figure out how to approach this project but I keep getting overwhelmed by all the possibilities..."

*AI responds:* "I notice you're feeling overwhelmed by possibilities. What if we zoom in on just one aspect? What's the smallest, most concrete step you could take right now? Sometimes starting with the tiniest action can help us see the path forward."

## Credit / Author / Origin
Based on the concept of "writing as thinking" popularized by writing teachers and cognitive scientists. The idea that writing isn't just for communicating ideas, but for discovering them.
